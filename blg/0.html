    Due to some issues regarding servers, we have migrated to this page, kindly
    hosted for free by GitHub. We have gone with a single page format for
    simplicity and have chosen not to run JavaScript to improve our
    members/visitors privacy. The bandwidth required to view our page should be
    low, although third party resources may take some time.

    Thank you for your patience with us as we redesign our site and perform
    clan admin.
