    In the "Players" section, we now have a "White List", "Gray List" and
    "Black List". Players in the white list are confirmed active players,
    players in the gray list are to be confirmed active players and the black
    list contains inactive players or those that have left the clan.
    <br>
    <br>
    We are currently going through our active players, making sure that we
    remain one of the largest active clans. It would be useful if everybody who
    is an active player shared their contact details in the "Register" section
    in the "About".
