    There have been continued site improvements, please tell us if anything has
    gone wrong! Developing a static website with the look and feel of a dynamic
    website is quite difficult, let alone the fact that we're trying to not use
    JavaScript.

    If you experience any issues, please use our "Contact" section and we'll
    try to replicate the problem to fix it.
